          Hi - I&apos;m Chad Cameron, Co-Founder of Voluntaria.
        </h2>
        <p>
          My partners, Chuck, Santori and I co-founded Voluntaria to create a
          safe haven from whatever crisis may come next.
          <br />
          <br />
          And let me tell you - it was NOT easy.

            We spent over a year looking at properties, sorting
            financing, dealing with legal hurdles and negotiating agreements.

            But now, we&apos;re making YOUR bugout planning as easy as online shopping.

            <br />
            Everyone who joins the Voluntaria SHM program is like you. We&apos;re all

            something about it. We&apos;re all willing to invest in emergency
            preparedness.
            <br />
            So if you&apos;re looking for community - join us on a group call. Create

            It doesn&apos;t need to take you years, like it did for us. And there&apos;s a
            reason why we say &ldquo;next week&rdquo; and not &ldquo;today&rdquo;. That&apos;s because the most
            important part of Voluntaria is that our community has a common set
            of values.
            <br />
            So, we&apos;ll do a phone call with you first. Because, if you&apos;re a
            social justice warrior who &ldquo;identifies as a cat&rdquo;&hellip;nothing personal it
            just won&apos;t be a good fit.
            <br />
            Once you assure us that{' '}
            <b>
              we&apos;re all on the same page
            </b>
            , you can just resolve payment, and your membership is secured for 1 year!
            <br />
            You&apos;ll <b>finally</b> have a bugout location, all figured out in the event of the next crisis.
            So no matter what happens - you&apos;ll have a
            safe, secure place to go.
