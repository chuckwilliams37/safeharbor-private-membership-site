            Reliable food security - even if you arrive with nothing

            <p>
              We&apos;re proud of the abundance of fish and game at Voluntaria, but we&apos;re
              also realists. We won&apos;t know how effective our group will be at
              fishing and trapping, until you all get here and actually do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last thing we want is to have dozens of people gathered in a
              crisis&hellip;with a shortage of food.
            </p>
            <p>
              So - we&apos;re not taking ANY chances with food security. We&apos;re making
              sure there&apos;s plenty of food in storage in addition to anything we fish
              or trap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hopefully you&apos;ve already been prepping, and stockpiling food. And
              when/if the SHTF, we definitely want you to bring your stockpile of
              food, when you come to Voluntaria.
            </p>
            <p>
              But - we also know that might not be possible or practical.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe you&apos;re escaping fire or direct energy attack, and your home and
              food stores are destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or maybe you&apos;ve prepped properly, but other Voluntaria members arrive
              without any food. The last thing we want is for you to arrive
              expecting safety&hellip;only to have desperate people begging or even
              threatening you, for your food.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&apos;s a recipe for disaster that we plan to avoid.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&apos;s why we&apos;re stocking a three month supply of survival food for
              every Voluntaria member.
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;ll order this food straight from My Patriot Supply, and store it
              for you on-site. This way, it&apos;s guaranteed to be here when it&apos;s
              needed. So, even if you or your neighbors arrive at Voluntaria with
              nothing but the clothes on their back - we&apos;ll have enough food for
              everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you ever want to cancel your Voluntaria membership, that food
              is yours - you&apos;re welcome to come and pick it up, or we can help you
              ship it to you or we can try to arrange to connect you with an
              incoming party who can buy it from you.

              When your survival - and your family&apos;s survival - is on the line, you
              need to be absolutely sure that you have enough fuel and the proper
              shelter to survive the elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Mother Nature is unforgiving, and you don&apos;t have room for
              mistakes&hellip; &hellip;except in Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
              You&apos;ll love the temperate climate of our location in Crescent City,
              Florida. Mother Nature is gentle here year-round - so even in the
              event of power or fuel shortage, it&apos;s not hard to survive. Voluntaria
              is located about an hours drive west of Palm Coast FL. The beauty of
              being this far inland is hurricanes don&apos;t traverse over land well so
              although we do get storms it&apos;s nothing like what happens at the coast.
              So with respect to hurricanes we are in a great spot.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, most of the time you&apos;ll be quite comfortable - even without
              climate control&hellip; &hellip;year-round!

              <li>The 52 acres include abundant forest with trees for firewood - so you&apos;ll always be able to get toasty warm by the bonfire with your Voluntaria friends and family.</li>

            <p>
              We&apos;re not a fan of any government, but Florida&apos;s government has been
              one of the freest, least insane governments in the entire country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida&apos;s governor, Ron DeSantis, was one of the first to end COVID
              lockdowns (not that lockdowns were EVER acceptable in the first
              place&hellip;but that&apos;s why you need a bugout plan instead of just moving to
              Florida).
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida also allows concealed carry without a permit. So, when/if the
              SHTF, you&apos;ll be able to bring your guns and carry them, legally -
              without needing to scramble and try to apply for permits (from
              criminal entities) in a crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              We even have plans to create a shooting range as to encourage everyone
              to sharpen or acquire gun knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida also strongly supports property rights and self-defense - even
              encouraging homeowners to shoot burglars. With these types of laws and
              culture,{' '}
              <span className="font-semibold italic">Florida is extremely unattractive to looters</span>{' '}
              during a crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any state government is going to leave you alone when/if the
              SHTF&hellip;it&apos;s gonna be Florida!
