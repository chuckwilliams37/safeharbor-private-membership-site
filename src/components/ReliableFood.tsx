            Ensuring Food Security for All Voluntaria Members &ndash; Even if You Come with Nothing
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-base text-gray-700 sm:text-lg">
            <p>
             At Voluntaria, we&apos;re grateful for the natural abundance of fish and game. But we also understand the importance of planning ahead, especially when it comes to food security. Until everyone arrives and gets hands-on with fishing, hunting, and gathering, it&apos;s tough to predict exactly how successful we&apos;ll be.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last thing any of us wants in a time of need is to gather together and face a shortage of food.
            </p>
            <p>
             To avoid this, we’re fully committed to ensuring there’s plenty of food storage, in addition to what we gather ourselves. We’re prioritizing a solid food supply so that no matter what, everyone here has what they need.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, you&apos;re already prepared and have your own stockpile of food. If a major crisis hits and you decide to join us, we encourage you to bring any supplies you&apos;ve stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, we recognize that might not always be possible. Circumstances beyond your control—such as natural disasters or other threats—might prevent you from bringing your supplies. Or perhaps, despite your own preparedness, other members arrive without any food. The last thing we want is for anyone to feel vulnerable or worried about their food supply once they&apos;re here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe you&apos;re escaping fire or direct energy attack, and your home and
              food stores are destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or maybe you&apos;ve prepped properly, but other Voluntaria members arrive
              without any food. The last thing we want is for you to arrive
              expecting safety&hellip;only to have desperate people begging or even
              threatening you, for your food.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&apos;s a recipe for disaster that we plan to avoid.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&apos;s why we&apos;re stocking a three month supply of survival food for
              every Voluntaria member.
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;ll order this food straight from My Patriot Supply, and store it
              for you on-site. This way, it&apos;s guaranteed to be here when it&apos;s
              needed. So, even if you or your neighbors arrive at Voluntaria with
              nothing but the clothes on their back - we&apos;ll have enough food for
              everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you ever want to cancel your Voluntaria membership, that food
              is yours - you&apos;re welcome to come and pick it up, or we can help you
              ship it or arrange to connect you with an incoming buyer.
            </p>

            Off-grid survival is easy in Florida&apos;s gentle climate

              When your survival - and your family&apos;s survival - is on the line, you
              need to be absolutely sure that you have enough fuel and the proper
              shelter to survive the elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Mother Nature is unforgiving, you can&apos;t leave room for mistakes.

            <p>
              You&apos;ll love the temperate climate of our location in Crescent City,
              Florida. The weather is gentle here year-round - so even in the
              event of power or fuel shortage, it&apos;s not hard to survive. Voluntaria
              is located about an hours drive west of Palm Coast FL. The beauty of
              being this far inland is hurricanes don&apos;t traverse over land well so
              although we do get storms it&apos;s nothing like what happens at the coast.
              So with respect to hurricanes we are in a great spot.

            <p>
              In fact, most of the time you&apos;ll be quite comfortable - even without
              climate control&hellip; &hellip;year-round!

            <p>
              We&apos;re not a fan of any government, but Florida&apos;s government has been
              one of the freest, least insane governments in the entire country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida&apos;s governor, Ron DeSantis, was one of the first to end COVID
              lockdowns (not that lockdowns were EVER acceptable in the first
              place&hellip; but that&apos;s why you need a bugout plan instead of just moving to
              Florida).
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida also allows concealed carry without a permit. So, when/if the
              SHTF, you&apos;ll be able to bring your guns and carry them, legally -
              without needing to scramble and ask permission. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We even have plans to create a shooting range as to encourage everyone
              to sharpen or acquire gun skills and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida also strongly supports property rights and self-defense - even
              encouraging homeowners to shoot burglars. With these types of laws and
              culture,{' '}
              <span className="font-semibold italic">Florida is extremely unattractive to looters</span>{' '}
              during a crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any state government is going to leave you alone when/if the
              SHTF&hellip;it&apos;s probably going to be Florida!
