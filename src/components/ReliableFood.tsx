          Reliable food security - even if you arrive with nothing
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We're proud of the abundance of fish and game at Voluntaria, but we're
          also realists. We won't know how effective our group will be at
          fishing and trapping, until you all get here and actually do it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The last thing we want is to have dozens of people gathered in a
          crisis…with a shortage of food.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          So - we're not taking ANY chances with food security. We're making
          sure there's plenty of food in storage in addition to anything we fish
          or trap.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Hopefully you've already been prepping, and stockpiling food. And
          when/if the SHTF, we definitely want you to bring your stockpile of
          food, when you come to Voluntaria.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          But - we also know that might not be possible or practical.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Maybe you're escaping fire or direct energy attack, and your home and
          food stores are destroyed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Or maybe you've prepped properly, but other Voluntaria members arrive
          without any food. The last thing we want is for you to arrive
          expecting safety…only to have desperate people begging or even
          threatening you, for your food.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          That's a recipe for disaster that we plan to avoid
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          That's why we're stocking a three month supply of survival food for
          every Voluntaria member.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We'll order this food straight from My Patriot Supply, and store it
          for you on-site. This way, it's guaranteed to be here when it's
          needed. So, even if you or your neighbors arrive at Voluntaria with
          nothing but the clothes on their back - we'll have enough food for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          And if you ever want to cancel your Voluntaria membership, that food
          is yours - you're welcome to come and pick it up, or we can help you
          ship it to you or we can try to arrange to connect you with an
          incoming party who can buy it from you.
        </p>

          Off-grid survival is easy in Florida's gentle climate
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          When your survival - and your family's survival - is on the line, you
          need to be absolutely sure that you have enough fuel and the proper
          shelter to survive the elements.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Because Mother Nature is unforgiving, and you don't have room for
          mistakes… …except in Florida.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You'll love the temperate climate of our location in Crescent City,
          Florida. Mother Nature is gentle here year-round - so even in the
          event of power or fuel shortage, it's not hard to survive. Voluntaria
          is located about an hours drive west of Palm Coast FL. The beauty of
          being this far inland is hurricanes don’t traverse over land well so
          although we do get storms it’s nothing like what happens at the coast.
          So with respect to hurricanes we are in a great spot.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In fact, most of the time you'll be quite comfortable - even without
          climate control… …year-round!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 font-bold">At the coldest end of the spectrum:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In winter, you'll see highs and lows of 69 / 47 F (or 21 / 8 C).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The coldest winter temperatures are generally manageable with warm
          clothes and a sleeping bag.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The 52 acres include abundant forest with trees for firewood - so
          you'll always be able to get toasty warm by the bonfire with your
          Voluntaria friends and family.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 font-bold">At the hottest end of the spectrum:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In summer, you'll see highs and lows of 91 / 74 (or 33 / 23 C)
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The property includes lush sections of forest and trees for shade, so
          anytime you like, you can enjoy the shade, or even move your entire RV
          into the shade of the forest.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You can always beat the heat with a dip in the pond or the spring
          on-site, or enjoy a day at Crescent Lake, just 1 mile away. Or a beach
          day about an hour away.

          We're not a fan of any government, but Florida's government has been
          one of the freest, least insane governments in the entire country.

        <p className="mb-2">
          Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, was one of the first to end COVID
          lockdowns (not that lockdowns were EVER acceptable in the first
          place…but that's why you need a bugout plan instead of just moving to
          Florida).

        <p className="mb-2">
          Florida also allows concealed carry without a permit. So, when/if the
          SHTF, you'll be able to bring your guns and carry them, legally -
          without needing to scramble and try to apply for permits (from
          criminal entities) in a crisis.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We even have plans to create a shooting range as to encourage everyone
          to sharpen or acquire gun knowledge.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Florida also strongly supports property rights and self-defense - even
          encouraging homeowners to shoot burglars. With these types of laws and
