            The sooner you join Voluntaria, the more say you&apos;ll have on what we
            build next. When you&apos;re one of just a handful of members, you&apos;ll
            have maximum input, because you won&apos;t be competing with other
            members&apos; priorities. We can give maximum attention to the projects
            that are most important to the group.

              You&apos;ve been under massive stress these last 4 years. The lockdowns,
              your friends calling you a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist,
              the financial stress, and the constant psychological torture. You
              need a vacation!
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of your membership, we&apos;re inviting you to enjoy a week stay
              at Voluntaria. Bring your RV, stay at the property, help us with a project,
              and use our community kitchen. Brainstorm with us on what to do next and how to do it. 
              Perhaps you have some skills in a certain area that you would like to
              contribute? We are open to anything that is a win-win and helps us
              move the project forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              For your 3 weeks annual stay, bring your trailer, car camp, or if you don&apos;t have
              an RV, there is a small hotel about a 5-minute drive away.
            </p>

              Imagine&hellip; waking up to the serene beauty of the forest and
              meadows. You take a peaceful morning walk, breathing in the crisp,
              fresh air. With your family, you might spot turtles by the tranquil
              pond or enjoy a game of fetch with your dog in the spacious meadows.
              For a gentle adventure, you could visit nearby Crescent Lake for some
              relaxing fishing or borrow our kayaks to explore the calm waters.
              As evening falls, gather around a warm campfire with your loved ones,
              roasting marshmallows and reflecting on the day&apos;s simple joys,
              following a communal meal prepared together.
