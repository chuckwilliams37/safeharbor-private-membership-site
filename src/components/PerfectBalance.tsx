                We've carefully chosen this land for its proximity to
                like-minded people, and its distance from "The Zombies" - not
                just at the state-level, but also in the community and immediate

                  The land is shaped in a massive square, so there's plenty of
                  privacy from onlookers (unlike other properties, that are long
                  and skinny)

                  The main road is over 500 meters away from the property,
                  offering plenty of privacy (in the unlikely event that Florida
                  decides to turn into a full surveillance police state)

                <li>
                  The main road isn't even a major road - it's a simple 2-lane
                  country road with no shoulder and a low speed limit

                While we've been careful to find a place that is isolated enough
                to be safe, we've made sure that the property is easy for you
                and your family to access during a crisis or lockdown situation.
