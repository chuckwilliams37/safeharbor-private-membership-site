                    Voluntaria is a new project, but we are not new in this
                    space. One of our founders lived in an intentional community in California
                    for 2 years, from 2013 to 2015. He saw first-hand what works -{' '}
                    <b>and perhaps more importantly what doesn&apos;t.</b>

                      Want to learn more about our vision for community building? Watch two of our founders Chad Cameron and Chuck Williams discuss reimagining community through voluntaryist principles with health advocate Amandha Vollmer. They explore how self-governance and natural law can create more joyful, liberated communities.

                    We believe it all comes down to clear communication, common values,
                    individual rights&hellip;and cutting out the bullsh*t. This is
                    NOT a hippie commune where you&apos;ll own nothing and be
                    happy&hellip;and we sing nightly next to a campfire (although
                    depending on who is here and if someone can play guitar,
                    this might happen from time to time). This is an American
                    country village, where we honor the same principles that
                    created our country,<span className="font-bold"> valuing individual sovereignty above

                    We understand what it&apos;s like&hellip; <br />
                    To be shunned, yelled at and mocked&hellip; <br />
                    To be accused of &ldquo;killing grandma&rdquo; or &ldquo;spreading
                    misinformation&rdquo;&hellip; <br />
                    To lose our closest friends and family&hellip; <br />
                    Maybe some of us even had to leave our partners&hellip;or were left.

                    And since 2020 - or maybe even before - we&apos;ve felt alone.
                    Because now, when we meet the average person on the street,
                    we wonder if they&apos;re the type of person that would have
                    yelled in our faces or called the cops on us for not
                    wearing a mask or wanted to force inject us so we too
                    could participate in a medical experiment.
