              Right now, we&apos;re offering a basic boondocks solution at basic
              economy prices. As we raise money from membership sales, we&apos;ll be
              upgrading the property infrastructure. More solar power? A chicken
              coop? Greenhouses? We&apos;ll build out whatever our members prioritize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we sell 25 annual memberships, we&apos;ll reinvest $10,000 into the
              property - and naturally, we&apos;ll increase the price to reflect those
              upgrades. Our pricing will increase once we sell 25 memberships, and
              it will only go up from there.
            </p>
            <p>
              But our founding members will enjoy all infrastructure upgrades at
              current prices â€“ locked in for 3 years. We don&apos;t know how long it
              will take to reach, but we&apos;re excited about Voluntaria
              and think the rest of the world will be too. We&apos;re getting booked on
              a number of podcasts talking about our unique offering, so we don&apos;t
              think it will be long before we are sold out.
            </p>
            <p>
              We suggest locking in your price before we hit hyper-inflation. Depending on
              inflation and how fast the global economy devalues the dollar, we
              might need to raise prices substantially just to keep pace. But our
              members will lock in the price for 3 years, so even though our
              currency isn&apos;t stable, your bug-out plan is!
